We are Top Forte, top 40â€™s pun totally intended! We met at the University of Toronto in the music program in 2010 and have been playing together ever since for weddings and other events.

We take a lot of pride in arranging and performing very current songs from various genres (including pop, jazz, rock, etc.) as well as from video games and film.
